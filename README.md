# AeroWeather

This is the code of the *soon-to-be-published* Chrome Extension AeroWeather.

**AeroWeather** is a Chrome extension displaying the METAR report for a given airport.

Two differents displays will be used:
* A basic display just showing the raw report
* A detailed display with a clean interface, showing each aspect of the weather ( temperature, dew point, etc. )

The extension is still in development so it's not complete and a lot of information is missing ( plus it's ugly as fuck )
